##Guiding Principles of Branching and Source Control:

- Working branches should be in sync with each other to the extent that is reasonable (in reference to work load and deployment realities.)
- If a project is intended to be deployed after another project, then the expected first to deploy should have a feature toggle or other way of limiting effects if the second gets deployed first.
